## Summary
General decision-making strategy used by computers across a variety of strategic games, including 
- chess
- checkers
- mancala
- tic-tac-toe
## Game Tree
- In board games, we can think of the root node (Level 0) as the current state of the board, and the nodes at Level 1 as each possible state of the board depending on what the next move will be.
- In other words, Level 1 nodes account for each and every possible next move.
## Looking into the Future of the Game
- In a multiplayer game, we can imagine a game tree in which the root node is the current state of the board after Opponent B makes a move, and it’s Opponent A’s turn.
